        <p>Collapse-UI is basically, Arcdustry-UI but completely rewritten. well, some are ported of course since some are optimized and rewriting may result the same code anyways.</p>
        <p>It's initial v1.0 release, so nothing new here that much. but, I'll keep updating alongside with side projects.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="bold">What's New?</p>
        <p>- 10% Faster than Vanilla UI due to the code not being reused from vanilla.</p>
        <p>- UI with customizations/theme available in <pi class="bold">"Collapse-UI/UI/_global_variables.json"</pi></p>
        <p>- New optimized look and better support on all devices</p>
        <p>- New death screen</p>
        <p>- New UI look, with more complete simple dark mode (you can make it uh, light mode via theme config lmao)</p>
        <p>- Adjusted alot of layouts to match the current vanilla layout.</p>
        <p>- World selection screen now has more "compact" look. e.g some detail text are smaller and gray.</p>
